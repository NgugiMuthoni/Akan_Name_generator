            The Akan people of Ghana frequently name their children after the day of the week they were born and the order
            in
            which they were born. These "day names" have further meanings concerning the soul and character of the person.
            Middle names have considerably more variety and can refer to their birth order, twin status, or an ancestor's
            middle
            name.

          <p class="text-monospace">
            This naming tradition is shared throughout West Africa and the African diaspora. During the 18th–19th
            centuries,
            slaves in the Caribbean from the region that is modern-day Ghana were referred to as Coromantees. Many of the
            leaders of slave rebellions had "day names" including Cuffy or Kofi, Cudjoe or Kojo, and Quamina or
            Kwame/Kwamina.

            Most Ghanaians have at least one name from this system, even if they also have an English or Christian name.
            Notable
            figures with day names include Ghana's first president Kwame Nkrumah and former United Nations
            Secretary-General
            Kofi Annan.

          <p class="text-monospace">
            In the official orthography of the Twi language, the Ashanti versions of these names as spoken in Kumasi are
            as
            follows. The diacritics on á a̍ à represent high, mid, and low tone (tone does not need to be marked on every
            vowel), while the diacritic on a̩ is used for vowel harmony and can be ignored. (Diacritics are frequently
            dropped
            in any case.) Variants of the names are used in other languages, or may represent different transliteration
            schemes.
            The variants mostly consist of different affixes (in Ashanti, kwa- or ko- for men and a- plus -a or -wa for
            women).
            For example, among the Fante, the prefixes are kwe- and e-, respectively. Akan d̩wo is pronounced something
            like
            English Joe, but there do appear to be two sets of names for those born on Tuesday.
